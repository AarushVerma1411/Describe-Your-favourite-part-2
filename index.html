About
</h1>
   <p>I LOVE football because it is an all rounder. If you wanna get fit you got it as one of the main things in football is running.
If you want your mindset to be on corparation as football is all a sport about passing/coorparation. What else do you even want while playing a sport? Hand flexibility? You got it as there are throw-ins in football too and while trying to tackle a opponent player you are supposed to use a bit of a shoulder push, not too much that the whole point is conceded as a foul. Now any aspect left to be completed?</p>
